  This is an open search and is what our users are greeted with upon entering the site, including the branded logo, a search bar, two buttons, a randomized ad, and a bad advice quote at the bottom to spice up anyday.

  If the user clicks the question mark in the top right corner of the window, they are given a pop-up of sorts, that walk them through the purpose of the site and what they are capable of accomplishing with this tool.
